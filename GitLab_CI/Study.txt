GitLab CI

Cashe and Artifacts
Artifacts
- usually the output of build tool
- In Gitlab CI, artifacts are designed to save some compiled/generated part of the build
- Artifacts can be used to pass data between stages/jobs

Cache
- Caches are not to be used to store build result
- Cashe should only be used as a 'temporary storage for project dependencies'
